Command-line interface for the Rust implementation of the [WebGraph framework]
for graph compression.

This crate provides the `webgraph` CLI tool with various subcommands for working
with compressed graphs. The tool supports:

- **Building** accessory data structures (Elias-Fano offsets, DCF)
- **Converting** graphs between formats (arcs, ASCII, endianness)
- **Transforming** graphs (transpose, simplify)
- **Analyzing** graphs (code statistics)
- **Running** algorithms (Layered Label Propagation)
- **Benchmarking** graph operations

Each module correspond to a group of commands, and each command is
implemented as a submodule.

## Subcommands

- `analyze`: Compute statistics on graphs
- `bench`: Benchmark graph operations
- `build`: Build accessory graph data structures
- `check`: Check coherence of graph files
- `from`: Ingest data into graphs
- `perm`: Create and manipulate permutations
- `run`: Run algorithms on graphs
- `to`: Convert graphs between representations
- `transform`: Apply transformations to graphs

## Separate Binaries

This crate also provides specialized standalone binaries:

- `webgraph-dist`: Tools for computing graph properties based on distances
  (HyperBall, ExactSumSweep)
- `webgraph-sccs`: Compute strongly connected components

## Environment Variables

- `RUST_MIN_STACK`: Minimum thread stack size (in bytes); we suggest
  `RUST_MIN_STACK=8388608` (8MiB)
- `TMPDIR`: Where to store temporary files (potentially very large ones)
- `RUST_LOG`: Configuration for [`env_logger`]
